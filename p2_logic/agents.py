"""Implement Agents and Environments (Chapters 1-2).

Code originally from https://code.google.com/p/aima-python/

The class hierarchies are as follows:

Thing ## A physical object that can exist in an environment
    Agent
        Wumpus
    Dirt
    Wall
    ...

Environment ## An environment holds objects, runs simulations
    XYEnvironment
        VacuumEnvironment
        WumpusEnvironment

An agent program is a callable instance, taking percepts and choosing actions
    SimpleReflexAgentProgram
    ...

EnvGUI ## A window with a graphical representation of the Environment

EnvToolbar ## contains buttons for controlling EnvGUI

EnvCanvas ## Canvas to display the environment of an EnvGUI

"""

# TO DO:
# Implement grabbing correctly.
# When an object is grabbed, does it still have a location?
# What if it is released?
# What if the grabbed or the grabber is deleted?
# What if the grabber moves?
#
# Speed control in GUI does not have any effect -- fix it.
